👋 Hi, I'm Q, and this is my GITHUB home @universalbri

👀 I’m primarily interested in Virtual Reality, and for now - GTA5 modding leveraging Script Hook .Net with C#. Hailing from a corporate background, I also dabble in game design, ai, a little bit of machine learning, and understanding hacking from various perspectives. 

🌱 I’m currently spending time and effort on a C#/C++ Virtual Reality development alternative to Unreal and Unity that allows a minimal footprint / fast loading redistributable making it possible for a programmer to create a VR app entirely in C#. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any neat projects that might be aligned with the stated experience and general trajectories listed above.
